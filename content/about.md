My name is Julia Silge and I am a data scientist at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5468471/julia-silge). I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R, Jane Austen, black coffee, and red wine.

I studied physics and astronomy, finishing my PhD in 2005. I worked in academia (teaching and doing research) and ed tech before moving into data science and discovering R. Now, my background in astronomy, physics, and education has given me a strong foundation for using data to answer interesting questions and communicate about technical topics with diverse audiences. I wrote a book with [my collaborator Dave](http://varianceexplained.org/) about [text mining with R](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-tidy-approach/dp/1491981652/).

I live in Salt Lake City, UT, with my husband, three kids, and a handful of backyard chickens.
